# Nuxt-Folio 

## My portfolio made with nuxt.js
---
Responsive static site to expose myself and using it as showcase for my projects. Made with [**Nuxt.js**](https://github.com/nuxt) and its module [**nuxt-content**](https://github.com/nuxt/content).

First look to landing page:

User has two nav buttons at top left corner to slide in a sidebar with info about me:
